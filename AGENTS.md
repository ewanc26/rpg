# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents working in this repository. Human contributors
may find it useful too, but the audience is agents.

## Project overview

A top-down RPG starter template for **Godot 4.7** using the **.NET/Mono (C#)**
build. There is no GDScript in this project — all gameplay code is C#.

- Godot project name: `RPG Template` (matters: it determines the `user://` path)
- C# assembly name: `RPGTemplate` (`RPGTemplate.csproj`, `net8.0`)
- Main scene: `scenes/TitleScreen.tscn`
- Autoloads: `EventBus` (global signals), `GameManager` (scene changes, pause)

Target platforms are **macOS** and **SteamOS / Linux desktop** (Steam Deck).
Windows is not a runtime target and is not tested; do not add Windows-only
APIs or path assumptions. **File and directory names are held to a stricter,
fully platform-agnostic standard than the runtime targets** — including
Windows and exFAT constraints — because a name that is merely macOS-and-Linux
safe still breaks contributor checkouts, CI runners, and microSD copies. Those
rules are mandatory and are specified below.

## Environment setup

### macOS

```bash
brew install --cask godot-mono     # Godot 4.7 .NET editor (requires macOS 11+)
brew install --cask dotnet-sdk     # .NET 8 SDK or newer
```

- **Use the `godot-mono` cask, not `godot`.** The plain `godot` cask has no C#
  support and will fail to load every script in this project.
- The cask installs an app bundle into `/Applications`. Confirm its exact name
  before scripting against it — it has changed between releases:
  ```bash
  ls /Applications | grep -i godot
  GODOT="/Applications/Godot_mono.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot"   # adjust to match
  ```
- **Apple Silicon:** install the arm64 .NET SDK. A Rosetta/x64 `dotnet` paired
  with an arm64 Godot produces confusing native-load failures at runtime, not
  at build time. Check with `dotnet --info | grep -i architecture`.
- If a manually downloaded (non-Homebrew) Godot refuses to launch, clear the
  quarantine attribute: `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/<bundle>.app`.
  Homebrew casks normally handle this already.
- `user://` resolves to
  `~/Library/Application Support/Godot/app_userdata/RPG Template/`.
  `SaveSystem` writes `savegame.json` there.

### SteamOS (Steam Deck)

SteamOS 3.x is Arch-based with an **immutable, read-only root filesystem**.
Do not use `pacman` to install the editor or the .NET SDK — those changes are
wiped by the next SteamOS update, and `sudo steamos-readonly disable` is not
something to do on a user's machine. Use Flatpak, which persists across
updates.

In **Desktop Mode**:

```bash
flatpak install --user flathub org.godotengine.GodotSharp
flatpak run org.godotengine.GodotSharp
```

- Use `org.godotengine.GodotSharp`, **not** `org.godotengine.Godot` — the
  latter is the GDScript-only build. (Both Flatpaks are community-maintained,
  not official Godot builds.)
- The GodotSharp Flatpak bundles its own .NET 8 SDK, so no separate install is
  needed. In `Editor Settings > Dotnet > Builds`, make sure the build tool is
  **dotnet CLI**, not MSBuild (Mono).
- **Flatpak sandboxing** affects both ends of the filesystem:
  - The editor can only reach the project if it is under `$HOME` or you grant
    access explicitly (Flatseal, or `--filesystem=<path>`).
  - `user://` is redirected into the sandbox at
    `~/.var/app/org.godotengine.GodotSharp/data/godot/app_userdata/RPG Template/`.
    When a save file "doesn't appear" on the Deck, look there before assuming
    `SaveSystem` is broken.
- Outside Flatpak (plain Linux), `user://` is
  `~/.local/share/godot/app_userdata/RPG Template/`.

## Build and run

Preferred: open `project.godot` in the Godot .NET editor and press F5. Godot
builds the C# solution automatically and reports script errors in the editor,
which `dotnet build` alone will not catch.

Command line:

```bash
dotnet build                                  # compile C# only
"$GODOT" --headless --build-solutions --quit  # import assets + build solution
"$GODOT" --headless --quit                    # reimport assets, populate .godot/
```

There is **no automated test suite**. "Verified" means the project opened, the
solution built with no errors, and the change was exercised in a running game —
not that `dotnet build` exited 0. If you cannot launch Godot in your
environment, say so explicitly rather than implying the change was play-tested.

When you cannot run the editor, you can still statically check scene integrity:
`.tscn`/`.tres` files must have `load_steps` equal to the number of
`ext_resource` + `sub_resource` entries plus one, every `ExtResource("id")` /
`SubResource("id")` must resolve to a declared id, and every `NodePath("...")`
must match a node actually declared in that scene.

## File and directory naming — strict, non-negotiable

Every file and directory name in this repository must be portable across
**every** filesystem the project touches: case-insensitive APFS on macOS,
case-sensitive ext4/btrfs on SteamOS, exFAT on a Steam Deck microSD card, and
NTFS on any contributor's machine. Names are therefore restricted to the
lowest common denominator of all of them. This is not a style preference — the
excluded characters cause silent data loss, unreproducible build failures, or
files that cannot be checked out at all.

### The allowed set

Every path component (each directory name and each filename, including its
extension) **must** match this regex, and nothing outside it is permitted:

```
^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]*$
```

In words: ASCII letters and digits, plus `.` `_` `-`, and it must start with a
letter or digit. The only exception is a deliberate dotfile or dot-directory at
the repository root (`.gitignore`, `.github/`), which may take one leading dot.

### Explicitly forbidden

Do not create, rename to, or reference any name containing:

- **Spaces.** Break unquoted shell in build and export scripts. Use `-` or `_`.
- **Any non-ASCII character** — accented letters, CJK, emoji, curly quotes.
  macOS normalizes filenames to Unicode NFD while Linux stores NFC, so the same
  visible name becomes two different byte sequences. Git then reports a file
  that is simultaneously deleted and untracked, and the file silently fails to
  load on one of the two platforms.
- `< > : " / \ | ? *` and any control character (0x00–0x1F). Reserved on
  NTFS/exFAT; `:` additionally carries legacy path-separator meaning on macOS.
- `# % & { } $ ! ' @ + = ~ ^` and backtick. These survive on disk but break
  shell globbing, `res://` URI parsing, and Godot's `.import` bookkeeping.
- A **leading hyphen** (`-foo.tscn`), which CLI tools parse as a flag.
- A **trailing dot or trailing space** (`Player.tscn.`). Windows silently
  strips them, so the checked-out name stops matching the committed name.
- The **Windows reserved device names**, with or without an extension:
  `CON`, `PRN`, `AUX`, `NUL`, `COM0`–`COM9`, `LPT0`–`LPT9`. `NUL.cs` cannot be
  created on Windows at all, which makes the repo un-clonable there.
- **Two names in the same directory differing only by case** (`Player.cs` and
  `player.cs`). They coexist on SteamOS and collapse into one file on macOS,
  destroying one of them on checkout.

Keep each component under 255 bytes and total paths short.

### Required casing per file type

Casing is part of the name. Match the existing convention exactly:

| Kind | Convention | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Top-level directories | lowercase | `scripts/`, `scenes/`, `resources/` |
| Nested directories | PascalCase | `scripts/Systems/`, `scenes/UI/` |
| C# scripts | PascalCase, matching the primary type name | `PlayerController.cs` |
| Scenes (`.tscn`) | PascalCase, matching the root node name | `ItemPickup.tscn` |
| Resources (`.tres`) | snake_case | `health_potion.tres` |
| Root config and docs | whatever the tool requires | `project.godot`, `README.md` |

Do not rename existing files to "harmonize" these conventions unless asked to;
a rename that changes only case needs a two-step `git mv` to survive a
case-insensitive checkout, and it invalidates every `res://` reference and
`.uid` mapping pointing at the old name.

### Referencing paths from code and scenes

- Every `res://` and `user://` string must match the on-disk name **exactly**,
  byte for byte, including case. **Godot's exported PCK is case-sensitive on
  every platform**, so a mis-cased path can load correctly in the editor on
  macOS and still fail in the exported build on that same Mac. Passing on your
  machine proves nothing here.
- Never assemble game-data paths with `\` or `System.IO`; see the rule below.

### Verifying before you commit

These three checks must all come back empty. Run them from the repo root:

```bash
# 1. Any path component outside the allowed set
git ls-files | tr '/' '\n' | sort -u | grep -Ev '^\.?[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]*$'

# 2. Names colliding under case folding
git ls-files | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z' | sort | uniq -d

# 3. Windows reserved device names
git ls-files | tr '/' '\n' | sed 's/\..*//' | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z' \
  | grep -Ex 'CON|PRN|AUX|NUL|COM[0-9]|LPT[0-9]'
```

The repository currently passes all three. If you add files, it must still
pass — a violation is a blocking defect, not a nit to clean up later.

## Cross-platform rules

These are the failure modes that actually bite this project:

1. **Filesystem case sensitivity.** macOS APFS is case-insensitive by default;
   SteamOS (ext4/btrfs) is case-sensitive. A `res://Scenes/player.tscn`
   reference that loads fine on a Mac will fail to load on the Deck. Always
   match the on-disk casing exactly — see the naming rules above. This is the
   single most common way a macOS-authored change breaks on SteamOS.
2. **Never build paths with `\` or `System.IO` for game data.** Use `res://`
   and `user://` with Godot's `FileAccess`/`DirAccess`, as `SaveSystem` does.
3. **Line endings and file modes.** Exported Linux binaries need the executable
   bit. If a build is copied to a microSD card formatted exFAT, the exec bit is
   lost — `chmod +x` after copying.
4. **Do not hardcode a window size to one device.** The Steam Deck panel is
   1280×800 (16:10). If you touch display settings, keep the UI resizable and
   check both a 16:10 and a 16:9 aspect.

## Input and controller support

The input map in `project.godot` currently defines:

- Movement: Godot's built-in `ui_left` / `ui_right` / `ui_up` / `ui_down`
  (arrow keys, plus the engine's default joypad bindings)
- `interact`: **keyboard `E` only**

This means that on a Steam Deck in Game Mode, movement works via the built-in
joypad bindings but **`interact` is unreachable without a Steam Input remap**.
If you are adding or reworking controls, add explicit joypad bindings to
`interact` (and any new actions) rather than relying on users to remap. Prefer
adding dedicated `move_*` actions over depending on `ui_*`, which is really
meant for menu navigation.

## Code style

Match the existing code; it is consistent and deliberate:

- C# scripts attached to nodes are `public partial class X : <GodotType>`.
- Exported members use `[Export] public T Name { get; set; }` in PascalCase.
  **The property name in the C# file and the key in the `.tscn` file must match
  exactly** — a rename in one place silently breaks the other, and Godot will
  not warn you. Grep the `.tscn` files after renaming any exported property.
- Cross-system communication goes through `EventBus` signals, not direct node
  references. UI listens to `EventBus`; it does not poll the player.
- Subscribe to `EventBus` in `_Ready()` and **always unsubscribe in
  `_ExitTree()`** (see `HUD.cs`, `DialogueBox.cs`). The autoload outlives
  scenes, so a missed unsubscribe leaks into the next scene and fires callbacks
  on freed nodes.
- Guard autoload access with `?.` (`EventBus.Instance?.EmitSignal(...)`) —
  resources and tool scripts can run without the tree.
- Prefer `Resource` subclasses (`PlayerStats`, `InventoryItem`) with
  `[GlobalClass]` for authored data, so it is editable in the Inspector.
- Plain data that never enters the scene tree stays a plain C# class
  (`InventorySlot`) — do not derive from `Node`/`Resource` without reason.
- Comments explain *why*, sparingly. Do not add narration to obvious code.

## Do not commit

Already covered by `.gitignore`, but worth stating: never commit `.godot/`,
`bin/`, `obj/`, `.mono/`, `export_presets.cfg` (it can contain signing
identities and store credentials), `.DS_Store`, or `*.user` files. If you add
an export preset, do not commit macOS signing identities, notarization Apple
IDs, or app-specific passwords.

## Commits and pull requests

- Develop on the designated feature branch; never push directly to `main`.
- Write commit messages that explain the reasoning, not just the file list.
- Do not open a pull request unless explicitly asked.
- Do not reference the specific AI model used in commits, PRs, or code
  comments.
